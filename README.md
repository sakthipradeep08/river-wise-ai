# Smart Flood Alert System (SFAS)

An AI-based flood forecasting and community alert system designed to provide early flood risk prediction using historical rainfall data and river-level indicators.

## Problem Statement
Floods cause severe loss of life and property due to delayed warnings, fragmented data, and lack of clear communication to communities.

## Our Solution
SFAS integrates historical flood data, real-time user inputs, and AI-based risk scoring into a single, user-friendly dashboard that provides:
- Flood risk prediction
- Early warnings
- Emergency alerts
- Rescue resource allocation

## Features
- Location-based flood risk analysis
- Rainfall input (numeric + color-coded levels)
- River-level severity detection
- Flood risk score (0–100) with visual charts
- Emergency popup alerts for high-risk scenarios
- Rescue resource recommendations
- Modern, scroll-based dashboard UI

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- UI Generation: Lovable AI
- Visualization: Charts & animations
- Data: Historical dummy flood datasets

## How It Works
1. User enters location, rainfall, and river condition
2. AI analyzes inputs along with historical data
3. Risk score is calculated and visualized
4. Alerts and rescue suggestions are triggered automatically

## Hackathon Note
This project was developed as a prototype for hackathon demonstration, focusing on usability, explainable AI, and disaster preparedness.
